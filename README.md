# Denoising-Autoencoder
A learning project where I implemented a CNN based denoising autoencoder for denoising images. Trained separate models on BSD100 and FFHQ datasets with gaussian noise. <br> Please refer to the project file by the name _'Denoising autoencoder project file - Atharva Joshi'_ for Architecture, Results and Visualisation of some learned kernels.
